    <p><strong>SODA MACHINE - </strong>
        Do you think a leprechaun is the one who makes the soda machine work?
        That's not exactly how it works, it all starts when you insert the money, a scanner verifies if you put the
        correct amount and makes the machine follow with the process or gives you back your money, if you put too much
        money, the machine gives you back the change, amazing isn't it?
        After the payment process, comes the process of the machine releasing the soda you have chosen, it is a process
        that mixes intelligence with mechanics, the machine verifies your choice and releases a single can of your
        choice, there is no point in shaking the machine it will not release more than one, magically it will release
        your cold drink, amazing isn't it?</p>
