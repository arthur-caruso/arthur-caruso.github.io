AI everywhere

In 2023, Artificial Intelligence (AI) became a reality in organizations. Code-free AI, with its easy drag-and-drop
interfaces, will allow any company to harness its power to create smarter products and services.
We are already seeing this trend in the retail market.
Stitch Fix uses AI-enabled algorithms to recommend clothes to its customers that match their sizes and tastes.
Autonomous and contactless shopping and delivery will also be a big trend for 2023.
AI will make it easier for consumers to pay for and receive goods and services.
AI will also augment nearly every job across every business process across every industry. More retailers will use AI to
manage and automate the complex inventory management processes that happen behind the scenes, so convenience trends like
buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS), and buy online, return in store (BORIS ), will become the default.
AI will also be the engine behind the newest autonomous delivery initiatives that retailers are testing and
implementing, and more and more retail workers will need to get used to working alongside machines.
